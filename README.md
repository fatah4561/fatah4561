# About

A "brutalist" static portfolio by myself (Fatah At-Thariq / fatah4561) in an attempt to learn tailwind.css. Results is [here](https://fatah4561.github.io/).

## Instalation

The website can be run as it is since it is static website but if you intend to modify tailwind config you may need to:

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` when modifying tailwind.config.js / input.css
- Run `npm run build-ms` to build the website (microsoft windows), bash / linux coming soon
